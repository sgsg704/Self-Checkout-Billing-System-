# Self-Checkout-Billing-System-
Self-checkout (also known as self-service checkout and as semi-attended  customer-activated terminal, SACAT) machines provide a mechanism for  customers to process their own purchases from a retailer. They are an  alternative to the traditional cashier-staffed checkout. The customer performs  the job of the cashier themselves, by scanning and applying payment for the items. Traditionally billing requires a dedicated staff person to help the customers  complete their shopping by scanning bar code of the items taken and  generating amount to be paid thus requires additional manpower of staff and  also increases the cost for shop owners. Since the billing System for use by a staff person at the billing counter is made  for their use only, we propose to create a self-checkout system that is user  friendly such that the users can scan their items on their own.
